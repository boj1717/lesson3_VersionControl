            <p class="lead"> Versioning control systems that keeps a record of changes made to a file or set of files so that one can recall specific versions of those files. While it seems like that isn’t a significant thing, because you probably have gotten so used to it in your daily life, the ability for multiple versions of a file to be recalled is a huge step forward for the Technology community. It allows for multiple users to edit versions of a file and then upload that so others can see the changes while they are working on a file themselves. This allows multiple people to work on a file from separate locations at the same time which is very important to my field. Its also important to our class because it allows me to work on the same file from multiple computers. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local Version control method is when a person copies their files directly into another directory. This is the most common Version Control Method that people use, mainly because it is the simplest to preform and use. However local VCS does have its down falls at the user is responsible for remembering what directory they have copied the files into. Programs such as RCS were created to help better this style of VCS, as it worked to keep patches in a special format on disks, and then recreating those files by adding up the patches. This is interesting because it is the most common form of VCS, therefore its most likely the ones I will interact with most. .</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized Version Control Systems where the next development in the Version Control Systems trilogy, with a purpose and focus on allowing people to collaborate with one another, even on different systems. It performs this by using a single server to contain all the files, from which users “check” out files from.  CVS also allows other people to see what other people are doing on the file at the same time, an important innovation for developers as it allows people to calibrate easier. The biggest issue with this system is that if the central system with the files on it crashes, than no one can access those files, no matter where they are. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Unlike in Centralized Version control Systems where users “check” out files, in Distributed Version Control Systems users create copies of the files, mirroring the repository. This means that even if the server with the original files crashes, the copies on the other systems are still available for people to work on. This features also allows even more users to calibrate at the same time on projects as there are several types of work flows available. This is extremely important as it can stream line the work system. I find it interesting because of the fact that it is a system that isn’t completely reliant on the original file. </p>

            <p class="lead">Git is a type of distributed version control system that is very common among those in technology-based fields, both at the professional level as well as the university level. Despite being free to use, the program is extremely efficient whether being used to complete big or small projects, having high user speeds. Another popular feature of GitHub is that it uses a small footprint. It doesn’t require large downloads or much effort from the user. This is important to this class because it gives us students an effective tool for backing up our work without costing us money. </p>
